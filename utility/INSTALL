Here we provide an installation guide for all supported platforms.


1) Linux (tested on Ubuntu and Debian)
--------------------------------------
First install the following software dependencies:
    - g++ (any version supporting C++11 standard, e.g. 4.8. or newer)
    - cmake (minimal version is 2.8)
    - boost C++ libraries (minimal version is 1.59.0)

Building in a terminal:

    $ mkdir ./build
    $ cd ./build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make install

If you want to know more about the compilation options:
    $ cmake ..
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Release|Debug>


All built binaries can be found in the directory:

    ./build/../bin/Linux_${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}/lib


2) MS-Windows 10
----------------
First install the following software dependencies:
    - Visual Studio 2015
    - cmake (minimal version is 2.8)
    - boost C++ libraries (minimal version is 1.59.0)

Next generate Visual Studio project files in a terminal:

    > mkdir ./build
    > cd ./build
    > cmake .. -DBOOST_INSTALL_DIR=<install-dir-of-boost>
    
where <install-dir-of-boost> is the disc path where you installed boost.

Start Visual Studio for the generated project files in terminal:

    > utility.sln

Bulding the library in the started Visual Studio:

    1. In the menu select "Build/Batch Build ..." (hot key Ctrl+B). 
    2. In the oppened dialog check the project "INSTALL" for configurations
       you want to build (Debug, MinSizeRel, Release, and RelWithDebInfo).
    3. Press the button "Build".

The built binaries will be stored in directories:
    
    ./build/../bin/Windows_<build-configuration-type>/lib

where <build-configuration-type> may be Debug, MinSizeRel, Release, or RelWithDebInfo.
